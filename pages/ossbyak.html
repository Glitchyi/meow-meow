    <h1>History of Open Source</h1>

    <p>Open source software is a type of computer software with its source code made available under a license that allows anyone to study, change, and distribute the software, even for commercial purposes. This contrasts with proprietary software, where the source code is kept secret and only the compiled code is distributed.</p>

    <h2>Key Milestones</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1960s:</strong> Early examples of open-source collaboration, such as the MIT Project MAC and the UNIX operating system.</li>
        <li><strong>1980s:</strong> The GNU Project, founded by Richard Stallman, aims to create a complete free software operating system.</li>
        <li><strong>1991:</strong> Linus Torvalds releases the Linux kernel, a free operating system kernel that becomes the foundation for many open-source distributions.</li>
        <li><strong>1998:</strong> The Apache Software Foundation is formed, becoming a major contributor to open-source web technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>2000s:</strong> The rise of open-source databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and web frameworks (Ruby on Rails, Django).</li>
        <li><strong>2010s:</strong> The popularity of cloud computing and DevOps, often driven by open-source tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact of Open Source</h2>
    <p>Open source has had a profound impact on the technology industry and beyond. Some of the benefits include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Innovation:** Open source fosters collaboration and innovation, leading to new ideas and technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:** Many open-source projects have a large community of developers working to improve and maintain the software.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-effectiveness:** Open source software is often free or available at a lower cost compared to proprietary alternatives.</li>
    </ul>
